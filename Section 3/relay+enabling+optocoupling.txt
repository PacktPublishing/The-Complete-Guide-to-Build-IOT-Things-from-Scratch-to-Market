Some advanced Settings

It has a 1x4 (2.54mm pitch) pin header for connecting power (5V and 0V), and for controlling the 2 relays. The pins are marked on the PCB:

GND - Connect 0V to this pin.
IN1 - Controls relay 1, active Low! Relay will turn on when this input goes below about 2.0V
IN2 - Controls relay 2, active Low! Relay will turn on when this input goes below about 2.0V
VCC - Connect 5V to this pin. Is used to power the opto couplers
There is a second 1x3 (2.54mm pitch) pin header for supplying the "relay side" of the board with 5V. At delivery, a jumper is present on this header selecting the 5V signal from the 1x4 pin header to power the relays. For default operation, don't change this jumper!

Advanced

The pins of the 1x3 pin header are marked on the PCB:

RY-VCC - This is the 5V required for the relays. At delivery, a jumper is present on this and the adjacent (VCC) pin.
VCC - This is the 5V VCC supplied on the 1x4 pin connector
GND - Connected to 0V pin of 1x4 pin header
If opto isolation is required, an isolated 5V supply should be used. For normal operation, a jumper bewtween pins 1 and 2 selects the 5V signal from the 1x4 pin header. This means both the "input side", and "relay side" use the same 5V supply, and there is no opto-isolation.
